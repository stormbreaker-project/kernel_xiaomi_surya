	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.

	  Deduplicate ZRAM data to reduce amount of memory consumption.
	  Advantage largely depends on the workload. In some cases, this
          option reduces memory usage to the half. However, if there is no
	  duplicated data, the amount of memory consumption would be
	  increased due to additional metadata usage. And, there is
	  computation time trade-off. Please check the benefit before
	  enabling this option. Experiment shows the positive effect when
	  the zram is used as blockdev and is used to store build output.

	 With incompressible page, there is no memory saving to keep it
	 in memory. Instead, write it out to backing device.
	 For this feature, admin should set up backing device via
	 /sys/block/zramX/backing_dev.

	 With /sys/block/zramX/{idle,writeback}, application could ask
	 idle page's writeback to the backing device to save in memory.

	 See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.

	  /sys/kernel/debug/zram/zramX/block_state.

	  See Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt for more information.
